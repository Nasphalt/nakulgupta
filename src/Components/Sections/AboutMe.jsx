        I'm a Front-End Software Developer with over 10 years of experience,
        currently working as a Technical Lead. I started my journey in mobile
        application development, where I spent 4.5 years honing my skills in
        building smooth, user-friendly apps. Eventually, my curiosity and
        passion for web experiences led me to front-end web development, where
        I’ve spent the last 5.5 years creating clean, responsive, and accessible
        interfaces that people enjoy using.

        I love the creative problem-solving that comes with front-end
        work—bringing designs to life, optimizing performance, and crafting
        interactions that feel just right. As a tech lead, I find equal joy in
        mentoring teammates, making thoughtful architectural decisions, and
        staying close to the code. For me, great software isn’t just about
        functionality—it’s about creating something that feels intuitive,
        reliable, and even a little delightful.
